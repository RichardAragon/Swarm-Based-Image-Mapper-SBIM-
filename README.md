# Swarm-Based Image Mapper (SBIM)

Swarm-Based Image Mapper (**SBIM**) is an innovative image processing framework that treats images as **Gaussian Probability Spaces**. By leveraging **Swarm Intelligence**, SBIM uses a collection of agents to iteratively "map" an image space and reconstruct a target image through self-supervised denoising. The approach is computationally efficient and mathematically elegant, bypassing the need for complex architectures like Transformers.

## Overview
SBIM provides a novel method for image reconstruction using swarm-based agents. Inspired by swarm intelligence and probabilistic methods, it progressively refines an image from Gaussian noise into a high-quality approximation of a target image.

This project demonstrates:
- How images can be modeled as **probability spaces**.
- The power of **self-supervised learning** using perceptual loss.
- Computational efficiency by avoiding pixel-by-pixel generative modeling.

---

## Key Features
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Uses independent agents that explore and refine the image space.
- **Gaussian Noise Framework**: Starts with random noise and iteratively denoises the image.
- **Perceptual Loss**: Uses **MobileNetV2** to compute feature-based perceptual loss, ensuring high-level similarity.
- **Noise Scheduling**: Progressive noise reduction for efficient convergence.
- **Modular and Lightweight**: Designed for easy experimentation and extensibility.
- **Save/Load States**: Save agent states for resuming training.

---

## How It Works

1. **Image as Gaussian Space**:  
   - The image is treated as a Gaussian probability space, initialized with random noise.

2. **Swarm Agents**:  
   - A group of agents is initialized with random positions and velocities.
   - Agents iteratively update their positions to approximate the target image, reducing noise over time.

3. **Perceptual Loss**:  
   - Rather than reconstructing pixel values, SBIM minimizes the difference in **feature space** using MobileNetV2 as a perceptual encoder.

4. **Noise Scheduling**:  
   - A noise reduction schedule ensures gradual refinement from coarse to fine details.

5. **Denoising and Mapping**:  
   - At each timestep, agents adjust their positions using the target image and added noise. The swarm collectively reconstructs the image.

## Usage

### Training the Model

Run the following command to train SBIM with a target image:

```bash
python sbim.py
```

#### Parameters:
- **Image Path**: Path to the target image (`target_image.jpg`).
- **Number of Agents**: Number of swarm agents (e.g., `500`).
- **Epochs**: Number of training iterations.

You can adjust these parameters in the `__main__` section of `sbim.py`.

---

### Example Output

After running the training, SBIM will display the following:
- **Training Progress**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) logged at each epoch.
- **Intermediate Images**: Visual outputs at regular intervals.
- **Final Generated Image**: Displayed at the end of training.

The model will also save agent states to `sbim_model.npy` for future use.

---

### Resuming Training

To resume training from a saved state:
1. Load the saved model file:
   ```python
   sbim.load_model("sbim_model.npy")
   ```
2. Continue training as usual.

---

### Generating New Images

To generate a new image using trained agents:
```python
new_image = sbim.generate_image()
plt.imshow(new_image)
plt.show()
```

## Future Improvements
- **Adaptive Noise Schedules**: Replace linear noise reduction with adaptive strategies.
- **Hierarchical Agents**: Introduce multi-scale agents for better spatial resolution.
- **High-Resolution Support**: Expand to larger image resolutions (e.g., 512x512).
- **Integration with Other Architectures**: Combine SBIM with transformers or diffusion models.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare results with I-JEPA and other self-supervised frameworks.
